# PREDICTING SOIL PROPERTIES

My goal is this project was to develop models to predict soil functional properties which are essential in understanding the soil's capacity to support essential ecosystem services such as primary productivity, nutrient and water retention, and resistance to soil erosion. The functional properties to be predicted are: Mehlich-3 extractable Calcium(Ca), Mehlich-3 extractable Phosphorus(P), Soil organic carbon(SOC), ph values(pH), Sand content(Sand). Spectra from diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy will be used as predictive features. This spectroscopy provides repeatable, rapid and low cost measurements of many soil functional properties. The dataset for this project is part of the kaggle competition dataset collection.

In this repo, I have included a link to the project report. Also included are the project report in html and md formats. Note that the programming language used in python.
